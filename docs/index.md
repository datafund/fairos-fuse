Fairdrive Desktop App is a FUSE client for fairOS-dfs. It lets you mount your
pod on your own user space and interact with your data.

# How do I configure FDA to connect to a bee node?

## FAQ about FDA config
#### "Is bee node running behind proxy?"

- On most of the cases this should be "No" if you are using a bee node directly or using your own bee.
- This option should be "Yes" when you are using the [gateway-proxy](https://github.com/ethersphere/gateway-proxy) service

#### What is "Bee"?

- This should be your bee api endpoint

#### What is "BatchID"?

- It is the stamp that will be user to upload your data into the swarm.

#### What is RPC? Why do we need it?

- An RPC (remote procedure call) endpoint is like a node's address: it's a URL which requests for blockchain data can be sent to. 
- We need this for user authentication for our portable account.

#### What is "Network"? Why does it have "Testnet" and "Play"? What is "Play"?

- Choosing this network determines the Ethereum network that will be used for ENS based portable accounts.
- Currently, we only have ENS contract deployed on Goerli Blockchain. That is why "Testnet".
- We have a small play environment for the whole FDP architecture, called [fdp-play](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fdp-play). If you want to use fdp-play behind FDA, this option is for you.  

#### What is "Mount Location"?

- FDA will create a `Fairdrive` directory in your mount location and mount pods in that directory.

## FAQ
#### How to mount?

![mount](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15252513/206395147-e9961710-0aa7-49b7-8a9b-a864566c9e83.gif)

#### Which is better, local light node, a full node on raspberry, or gateway?

- Using your own bee is always better for performance. A light node is good enough for using FDA, but a full node will perform better.

#### Where can I follow if the sync is happening?

- If you are using the same bee node for accessing your data, then there is no need to wait for sync. 
Once you create/move/update/delete data from your mount it will reflect everywhere.
